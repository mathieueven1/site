Starting October 1st, 2024, I am a postdoctoral researcher at Inria Montpellier, in the [Premedical](https://team.inria.fr/premedical/) team led by [Julie Josse](https://juliejosse.com/), working on topics related to causal inference and machine learning, applied to medical data.
I also work with the startup [Theremia Health](https://theremia.health/). 

Before that, I was a PhD student from September 2021 to June 2024 under the supervision of [Laurent Massoulié](https://www.di.ens.fr/laurent.massoulie/), working on the theory and algorithms of Machine Learning.
My PhD manuscript is available [here](https://hal.science/tel-04877971v1/document).
During my PhD, I was particularly interested in optimization (in all its form: distributed, decentralized, stochastic,...), topics related to Federated Learning, gossip algorithms and high-dimensional statistics, deep learning, and the theory of deep learning.
I was awarded an accessit to the [Gilles-Kahn PhD](https://www.socinfo.fr/palmares-du-prix-de-these-gilles-kahn-2024/) prize by the Société d'Informatique de France, sponsored by the French Académie des Sciences.

I was lucky to receive an [Outstanding Paper Award](https://blog.neurips.cc/2021/11/30/announcing-the-neurips-2021-award-recipients/) together with my colaborators at NeurIPS 2021, for our [continuized Nesterov acceleration](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2021/file/ec26fc2eb2b75aece19c70392dc744c2-Paper.pdf) paper.
I was a TA for courses at ENS Paris and at the M2 MASH held at PSL-Dauphine, that include Deep Learning courses (teachers: Marc Lelarge and Kevin Scaman) and Network Algorithms courses (teacher: Ana Busic). 
I interned at Microsoft Reasearch (Redmond, WA) in the Foundations of Machine Learning group in Fall 2022 and at EPLF in the TML team led by Nicolas Flammarion in Fall 2023.
