I am a PhD student since September 2021 under the supervision of Laurent Massoulié, working on the theory and algorithms of Machine Learning. I am particularly interested in optimization (in all its form: distributed, decentralized, stochastic,...), topics related to Federated Learning, gossip algorithms and high-dimensional statistics, deep learning, and the theory of deep learning.

During my PhD, I was a TA for courses at ENS Paris and at the M2 MASH held at PSL-Dauphine, that include Deep Learning courses (teachers: Marc Lelarge and Kevin Scaman) and Network Algorithms courses (teacher: Ana Busic). 

I interned at Microsoft Reasearch (Redmond, WA) in the Foundations of Machine Learning group in Fall 2022 and at EPLF in the TML team led by Nicolas Flammarion in Fall 2023.
