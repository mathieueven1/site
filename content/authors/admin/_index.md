Starting October 1st, 2024, I am a postdoctoral researcher at Inria Montpellier, in the [Premedical](https://team.inria.fr/premedical/) team led by [Julie Josse](https://juliejosse.com/), working on topics related to causal inference and machine learning, applied to medical data.
I also work with the startup [Theremia Health](https://theremia.health/). 

Before that, I was a PhD student from September 2021 to June 2024 under the supervision of [Laurent Massoulié](https://www.di.ens.fr/laurent.massoulie/), working on the theory and algorithms of Machine Learning. During my PhD, I was particularly interested in optimization (in all its form: distributed, decentralized, stochastic,...), topics related to Federated Learning, gossip algorithms and high-dimensional statistics, deep learning, and the theory of deep learning.

I was lucky to receive an [Outstanding Paper Award](https://blog.neurips.cc/2021/11/30/announcing-the-neurips-2021-award-recipients/) together with my colaborators at NeurIPS 2021, for our [continuized Nesterov acceleration](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2021/file/ec26fc2eb2b75aece19c70392dc744c2-Paper.pdf) paper.
I was a TA for courses at ENS Paris and at the M2 MASH held at PSL-Dauphine, that include Deep Learning courses (teachers: Marc Lelarge and Kevin Scaman) and Network Algorithms courses (teacher: Ana Busic). 
I interned at Microsoft Reasearch (Redmond, WA) in the Foundations of Machine Learning group in Fall 2022 and at EPLF in the TML team led by Nicolas Flammarion in Fall 2023.

Below is a not-up-to-date list of my publications; [here](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=fr&user=Mn8_1hQAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate) is a more-up-to-date list in chronological order.
